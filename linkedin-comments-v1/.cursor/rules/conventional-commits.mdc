# Git Commit Message Standard

All Git commit messages MUST follow the Conventional Commits specification

# Format:
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

Allowed Types:
feat: (A new feature)
fix: (A bug fix)
docs: (Documentation only changes)
style: (Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code - formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
refactor: (A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature)
perf: (A code change that improves performance)
test: (Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests)
chore: (Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries)

# Examples:
feat(api): add user authentication endpoint
fix(ui): correct button alignment on mobile
docs(readme): update setup instructions
refactor(auth): simplify token generation logic
